- Ok sorry if this update is less formal, but i've been working on this for 4 months and forgot what does this have, but from what can i remember, most important stuff is:
	- New visuals for both Omori and Sunny, their emotions are more expressive 
	- Rewrite of lots of mod mechanics, like some of shiny knife behavior 
	- A custom shiny knife interaction with Ludovico
