		Speed: 1.00

	Description: Sunny, as the same way as Omori, is a melee-ranged hibrid character, but instead of having full control over his emotions, it seems that this has gotten out of hand:
		Violin's Bow: 
			- Chargeable weapon, its speed charge depends on Tears stat, charges while firing tears (charges faster than Omori's knife)
			- Once charged, releasing the fire button will swing the bow, hitting 3 times, its damage multiplier will vary depending his emotion, but the base is x2 Sunny's Damage
			- Has some synergies with a few items
		Emotions:
			- Just like Omori, Sunny has a sort of emotions that changes his playstyle, but he can't control them at all, so player will need to be wise when emotion gestioning
				- Afraid: When being afraid, Sunny's stats will receive a negative multiplier/a downgrade, but his bow's damage multiplier will be raised to x3
				- Stressed Out: Plus the stats reduction from Afraid, now all receiving damage will be double, but his bow's damage multiplier will be raised to x4
				- If Sunny's Neutral and spends 1.5 seconds near at least one enemy, he will become Afraid
				- If Sunny's Afraid and spends 2 seconds near at least one enemy, he will become Stressed Out
		Calm Down:
			- Sunny's starting active, when using it, restores Sunny's Emotion to Neutral, and heals half red heart
		Birthright (Gather all your courage): 
			- Replace Calm Down with Overcome
				- Restores Sunny's Emotion to Neutral
				- Heals a full red heart
				- Raises bow's damage multiplier to x5 (only works once after Overcome use)
				
--- AUBREY (DW) --- (WORK IN PROGRESS, EXPECT HER IN v2.0.0)		
		
		- Aubrey will start with Pep Talk (3 charges active, it inflicts Happy and its stages)
		- Aubrey won't receive any penalty from Happiness
		- On receiving damage, Aubrey will have a change to counter with Mr. Plantegg
		- Pressing any emotion change for Omori will activate her Headbutt
			- Aubrey will receive a temporal speed upgrade
			- Aubrey won't be able to shoot tears
			- Colliding with an enemy will damage it (just need to think on a good formula)
			- If enemy doesn't die, Aubrey will take damage
			- If enemy dies, Aubrey won't receive damage (maybe she would also heal herself, idk)
