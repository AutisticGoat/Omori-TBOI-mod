	Description: Sunny, as the same way as Omori, is a melee-ranged hibrid character, but instead of having full control over his emotions, it seems that this has gotten out of hand:
		Violin's Bow: 
			- Chargeable weapon, its speed charge depends on Tears stat, charges while firing tears (charges faster than Omori's knife)
			- Once charged, releasing the fire button will swing the bow, hitting 3 times, its damage multiplier will vary depending his emotion, but the base is x2 Sunny's Damage
			- Has some synergies with a few items
		Emotions:
			- Just like Omori, Sunny has a sort of emotions that changes his playstyle, but he can't control them at all, so player will need to be wise when emotion gestioning
				- Afraid: When being afraid, Sunny's stats will receive a negative multiplier/a downgrade, but his bow's damage multiplier will be raised to x3
				- Stressed Out: Plus the stats reduction from Afraid, now all receiving damage will be double, but his bow's damage multiplier will be raised to x4
				- If Sunny's Neutral and spends 1.5 seconds near at least one enemy, he will become Afraid
				- If Sunny's Afraid and spends 2 seconds near at least one enemy, he will become Stressed Out
		Calm Down:
			- Sunny's starting active, when using it, restores Sunny's Emotion to Neutral, and heals half red heart
		Birthright (Gather all your courage): 
			- Replace Calm Down with Overcome
				- Restores Sunny's Emotion to Neutral
				- Heals a full red heart
				- Raises bow's damage multiplier to x5 (only works once after Overcome use)

	Description: Aubrey is meant to be a Tank, so she has high damage, low tears and speed, and 4 hearts, like Omori, she can inherit different emotions, but her mechanics will go arround Anger and some of her signature skills in OMORI:
		- Headbutt: if Aubrey is moving, pressing one of the buttons that cycles Omori's emotion, will trigger her Headbutt	
			- Aubrey will charge in the direction she was walkin
			- Hitting an enemy will damage it
			- Damage formula is (Aubrey's Damage * 2) * Aubrey's Speed stat (Min 1, )
			- If enemy survives, Aubrey will receive damage
			- If Aubrey Fails the Headbutt and collides with a wall or grid entity, she'll get Angry but won't receive any damage (Enraged if she was already Angry)
		- Counter:
			- If Aubrey receives contact damage from an enemy, she'll counter with Mr Eggplant:
				- Mr Eggplant damage formula is Aubrey's Damage * 3
				- Mr Eggplant will push enemies if they survive
				- Receiving Damage has a chance to enrage Aubrey
				- When killing an enemy with Mr Eggplant, Aubrey Has a chance to heal herself (1/2 heart), the angrier, the more chance of healing
		- Emotions: Just like Omori, Aubrey can inherit Emotions, but they'll work different with her:
			- Aubrey can only reach 2nd stage Emotions (Ecstatic, Enraged, Depressed)
			- Aubrey won't receive tears down from Anger (she'll got Damage upgrade and double taken damage chance)
			- Anger will increase damage of her Headbutt (Angry: x1.25, Enraged: x1.5)
		- Birthright (Mash)
			- Killing an enemy with Headbutt will always heal 1/2 heart
			- Increased heal chance from killing with MrEggplant (chance x1.5)

	Description: Just like Sunny, Aubrey has some problems to control her emotions, due the way how her friends left her behind after Mari's death, she got anger problems she still can't control, trying to land headbutts to relax her growing rage, also, she has her nailbat to smash some enemies with it:
		- Headbutt: Like her Dreamworld counterpart, Faraway Aubrey has a Headbutt to attack, but instead of having control of it, she can't control it when she gets Angry
			- Aubrey will charge in the direction she was walking (shooting if walking and shooting at the same time, head direction when not moving)
			- Aubrey is inmune to damage while headbutting
			- Hitting an enemy will damage it
			- Damage formula is (Aubrey's Damage * 2) * Aubrey's Speed stat
			- Landing succesfully a headbutt will relax Aubrey, returning her to Neutral emotion
			- Killing an enemy will heal Aubrey by 1/2 heart
			- Headbutt will only trigger in an uncleared room
		- Homerun: A chargeable attack of fixed 2 seconds, hits with her nailed bat
			- Charges when firing
			- Damage formula is: Aubrey's Damage * 2.5
			- When hitting an enemy, it will be pushed very hard
			- Small chance to instantly kill on hit (10%, 2% for bosses)
		- Emotions: Faraway Aubrey can also inherit Emotions, but, again, they'll work different
			- Aubrey can only reach 2nd stage Emotions (Ecstatic, Enraged, Depressed)
			- Aubrey will start Neutral, but if enough time passes, she'll got Angry, then Enraged 
			- When being in anger, she'll automatically charge to the direction she's walking (warning flashes will trigger before)
			- Enragement will only happen in an uncleared room
			- Anger will multiply Headbutt damage (Angry : x1.25, Enraged: x1.5)
		- Birthright (It means everything)
			- Aubrey will get Angry much faster
			- Reduced Homerun charge time (2 > 1.5)
			- Increased Headbutt damage mult: (3 > 4)
